boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .
other than not being a fan of click pads ( industry standard these days ) and the lousy internal speakers , it ' s hard for me to find things about this notebook i don ' t like , especially considering the $350 price tag .
works well , and i am extremely happy to be back to an apple os .
sure it ' s not light and slim but the features make up for it 100% .
i am pleased with the fast log on , speedy wifi connection and the long battery life ( >6 hrs ) .
made interneting ( part of my business ) very difficult to maintain .
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the mac mini is priced just right .
strong build though which really adds to its durability .
the battery life is excellent- 6-7 hours without charging .
i ' ve had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .
and i may be the only one but i am really liking windows 8 .
its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .
it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .
this thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything i could ask for .
keyboard responds well to presses .
lastly , windows 8 is annoying .
everything is so easy and intuitive tosetup or configure .
biggest complaint is windows 8 .
only 2 usb ports . . . seems kind of . . . limited .
amazing performance for anything i throw at it .
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .
the criticism has waned , and now i ' d be the first to recommend an air for truly portable computing .
but the performance of mac mini is a huge disappointment .
they don ' t just look good ; they deliver excellent performance .
the mountain lion os is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with microsoft windows .
enjoy using microsoft office !
incredible graphics and brilliant colors .
built-in apps are purely amazing .
i really like the size and i ' m a fan of the acers .
i opted for the squaretrade 3-year computer accidental protection warranty ( $1500-2000 ) which also support " accidents " like drops and spills that are not covered by applecare .
it ' s light and easy to transport .
once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed windows 8 set-up you may feel frustrated .
it ' s been time for a new laptop , and the only debate was which size of the mac laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .
the reason why i choose apple macbook because of their design and the aluminum casing .
the aluminum body sure makes it stand out .
it is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and usb devices are recognized almost instantly .
and the fact that apple is driving the 13 " rmbp with the intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered ( to me .
the durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .
but i was completely wrong , this computer is unbelievable amazing and easy to use .
exactly as posted plus a great value .
apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .
i do not like too much windows 8 .
startup times are incredibly long : over two minutes .
great price free shipping what else can i ask for ! !
this mouse is terrific .
it is really thick around the battery .
and windows 7 works like a charm .
: ) great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .
: ] it arrived so fast and customer service was great .
tried windows 8 and hated it ! ! !
set up was a breeze .
i am still in the process of learning about its features .
i had the same reasons as most pc users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of osx and lack of support for games .
i wanted it for it ' s mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .
i found the mini to be : exceptionally easy to set up
having usb3 is why i bought this mini .
the sound is nice and loud ; i don ' t have any problems with hearing anything .
the settings are not user-friendly either .
thank goodness for openoffice !
awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful ux .
i love the keyboard and the screen .
however , there are major issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .
i ' ve already upgraded o mavericks and i am impressed with everything about this computer .
not as fast as i would have expect for an i5 .
thanks for great service and shipping !
the performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iphoto work great with my phone and camera .
i did swap out the hard drive for a samsung 830 ssd which i highly recommend .
starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .
yes , that ' s a good thing , but it ' s made from aluminum that scratches easily .
quick and has built in virus control .
took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .
i was also informed that the components of the mac book were dirty .
the hardware problems have been so bad , i can ' t wait till it completely dies in 3 years , tops !
it ' s so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !
it ' s exactly what i wanted , and it has all the new features and whatnot .
can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a macbook ?
it feels cheap , the keyboard is not very sensitive .
though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .
it is very easy to navigate even for a novice .
does everything i need it to , has a wonderful battery life and i couldn ' t be happier .
great performance and quality .
i used windows xp , windows vista , and windows 7 extensively .
i did add a ssd drive and memory
on start up it asks endless questions just so itune can sell you more of their products .
i have been a pc user for a very long time now but i will get used to this new os .
one more thing , this mac does not come with restore disks and i am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer pc ' s , also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iphone/ipod touch cables .
i bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design .
i never tried any external mics with that imac .
i have experienced no problems , works as anticipated .
system is running great .
easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .
the mac mini , wireless keyboard / mouse and a hdmi cable is all i need to get some real work done .
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .
i work as a designer and coder and i needed a new buddy to work with , not gaming .
the new operating system makes this computer into a super ipad .
i can ' t believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .
the only issue came when i tried scanning to the mac .
it ' s just what we were looking for and it works great .
it ' s so quick and responsive that it makes working , surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !
it works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .
i ' m using this computer for word processing , web browsing , some gaming , and i ' m learning programming .
my wife was so excited to open the box , but quickly came to see that it did not function as it should .
